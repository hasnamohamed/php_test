## Thinking process

First thinking is how to create a simple full and secure website with it’s completely features admin and user and their permissions.
Started with database and then design then coding

## If I got additional time !
>  i would like to do it with laravel not php i did not see that i can do it with laravel i know laravel and i prefer it and of course I will be more carful for the design and I will grow the website to be have more features like I think comments for example and messages


## Some thing I learned during the task !
Well it’s not I learned but I knew more about sessions and clean code to do the task with best format and secure


## Useful links 

>  I used bootstrap website and google to search

## Love to share what exist In my task

I used MYSQL for database, OOP coding for the task ,PHP for coding and backend and for design I used HTML , CSS , Bootstrap if I have extra time I would use JS also 
And Session for securing and storing data type and finally cookies to stay login.
